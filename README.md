![Model results table](img/ModelMeasurementsPlot.png)

Our top four models (test accuracy) are BaggineClassifier, BernoulliNB, XGBClassifier and EnsembleHardVoting.

Defining avoidable bias as 1.0 - train accuracy. 1.0 is arguably an unrealistic figure for human level error. We can justify it given that over 250 submissions reported perfect accuracy scores.

Defining variance as the spread between test error and train error. Typically it is better to use the difference in dev error (validation error) and training error. In the case of our models, there is a wide margin between validation error and test error so we are including it in our variance error calculation.
